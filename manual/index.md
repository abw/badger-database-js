This is the manual for the `badger-database` Javascript module.

* [Installation](manual/installation.html)
* [Connecting](manual/connecting.html)
* [Tutorial](manual/tutorial.html)

## NOTE:

I'm in the process of rewriting the library to remove Knex.  These
pages haven't been updated yet and so will be out of date.

* [Database](manual/database.html)
* [Table](manual/table.html)
* [Record](manual/record.html)
* [Model](manual/model.html)
* [Queries](manual/queries.html)


These manual pages describe some of the internal implementation.
You probably don't need to worry about them too much unless you're
looking under the hood.

* [Connection](manual/connection.html)
* [Schema](manual/schema.html)
* [Tables](manual/tables.html)
