# Music Database Example

This directory contains a simple, but complete example of a
music database.  It uses a Sqlite memory database.  Be warned
that the database only persists while the example script is
running.

Install the dependencies using your package manager of choice
(I tend to use pnpm these days):

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

You should then be able to run the `example.js` script.

```bash
$ node example.js
```
