## SQL Made Easier

Badger Database is a library designed to simplify the process of working with
SQL databases.

It aims to be pragmatic, not dogmatic.  It implements some of the most
useful features of SQL query builders and ORMs, but doesn't stop you from
working with SQL queries when you need to.

It has support for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB and SQLite.  It is around 4k
lines of code, with a bundle size of around 17kB, minified and compressed.
