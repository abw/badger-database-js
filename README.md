# Badger Database

This is a work in progress to create a Javascript
database library loosely based on the Perl
[Badger::Database](https://github.com/abw/Badger-Database) library.

It is built around [Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/)

It is planned to help migrate some old Perl code
to Javascript and probably isn't going to be
suitable for new projects.
